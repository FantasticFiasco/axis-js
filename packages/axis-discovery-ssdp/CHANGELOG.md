## [5.0.0] - 2017-12-22

### :dizzy: Changed

- The property `macAddress` on `Device` changed type from `string | undefined` to `string`. Devices without a MAC address are now omitted from search results.

## [4.1.0] - 2017-11-27

### :zap: Added

- The option to specify a custom implementation of a HTTP client, where the default is based on [Request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request). This can be useful if discovery is required in an Electron application where one wish to benefit from the proxy configuration provided by using Electron's [net.request](https://electronjs.org/docs/api/net).

## [4.0.2] - 2017-10-14

### :syringe: Fixed

## [4.0.0] - 2017-07-04

### :zap: Added

- Support for enabling logs using [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug)

### :skull: Removed

- Support for Node.js v5 (v6 is LTS)

## [3.0.0] - 2017-06-26

### :dizzy: Changed

- Renamed `Device.serialNumber` to `Device.macAddress`. In most situations they are still the same, but the exceptions are the Axis products which bundle multiple physical devices into a single casing with a shared network interface. Because of the shared network interface they also share the same MAC address. This package is opinionated in that even though the devices via SSDP (UPnP) call the property _serial number_, it actually is a _MAC address_ and should be named accordingly.

## [2.0.0] - 2017-06-24

### :zap: Added

- [#2](https://github.com/FantasticFiasco/axis-discovery-ssdp-js/issues/2) - Calling `Discovery.stop()` stops listening for SSDP advertisements

### :dizzy: Changed

- Replaced `null` with `undefined` according to [TypeScript guidelines](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Coding-guidelines#null-and-undefined)

## [1.0.2] - 2017-01-26

### :syringe: Fixed

- [#40](https://github.com/FantasticFiasco/axis-discovery-ssdp-js/issues/40) - Calling `Discovery.search()` didn't trigger a new search

## [1.0.1] - 2016-12-06

### :syringe: Fixed

- Updated `README.md` in package

## [1.0.0] - 2016-12-04

### :zap: Added
